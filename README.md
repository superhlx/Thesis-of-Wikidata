# Thesis-of-Wikidata

2025/1/24 Installed GF on WSL2. Learned some basic syntax of SPARQL. https://github.com/superhlx/Thesis-of-Wikidata/blob/main/Some%20SPARQL%20statements.txt

2025/1/31 Something about gf in Python and answer to https://gist.github.com/inariksit/4469f3e5cf96a2afceed01c5f37b4031

2025/3/17 Due to some reason, work's been slowed down. Things that have been done include
1. Wrote two Python programs to check the data collected by Yuxiang and hate, extract those sentences that didn't get a parse, and extract them from the conllu file

2. Confirmed structure of mined documents

To do:
1. Use the descriptions that are currently available as inspiration and look at what descriptions (grammatical structure, adjectives, categories, etc.) are commonly

2. Write grammers and utilize the properties in props as evidence, to add one more modification function (or change an existing one, e.g. bigKind : Kind -> Kind to populationKind : Int -> Kind -> Kind), or add one more predication function, similar to CityDescription
